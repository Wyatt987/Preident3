        <h4>
          John Tyler was born on March 29, 1790, in Charles City County, Virginia, into a prominent aristocratic family.
          His father, John Tyler Sr., was a wealthy planter, judge, and close associate of Thomas Jefferson, while his
          mother, Mary Marot Armistead Tyler, passed away when he was just seven. Growing up among Virginia’s elite,
          Tyler
          was exposed to politics and law early on. He attended the College of William & Mary at the age of twelve,
          where
          he studied law before being admitted to the bar. His career began with service in the Virginia House of
          Delegates, followed by election to the U.S. House of Representatives and later as Governor of Virginia.
          Influenced by Jeffersonian ideals, Tyler became a strong advocate for states' rights and limited federal
          power,
          opposing large federal infrastructure projects. These beliefs would define his leadership in the years to
          come.

            John Tyler became the 10th president of the United States in 1841 after the unexpected death of
            William Henry Harrison, setting a crucial precedent for vice presidential succession. Despite being elected
            as
            Harrison’s running mate under the Whig Party, Tyler quickly clashed with his own party once in office. He
            vetoed
            a bill to re-establish the National Bank, a key Whig policy, which led to nearly all of his cabinet
            resigning
            and the Whigs formally expelling him from the party. Congress even attempted to impeach him—the first
            serious
            impeachment effort against a U.S. president. Despite these challenges, Tyler remained committed to his
            principles, advocating for limited federal power and states’ rights, which often put him at odds with both
            Congress and his former party. His presidency was marked by frequent use of the veto, earning him the
            nickname
            “His Accidency” from critics who saw him as an illegitimate leader.

              One of Tyler’s most significant achievements was the annexation of Texas, a controversial
              move that expanded U.S. territory but deepened the divide between pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions.
              He
              pushed for Texas' statehood despite opposition, laying the groundwork for the Mexican-American War.
              Additionally, his administration helped resolve a long-standing border dispute between Maine and Canada
              through the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, easing tensions with Britain. However, his presidency was largely
              marked by political isolation and resistance from Congress, making it difficult for him to enact broader
              policies.
              By the end of his term, John Tyler’s lack of party support left him without a path to re-election, and he
              retired to Virginia, later aligning himself with the Confederacy during the Civil War.
