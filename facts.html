      John Tyler was born on March 29, 1790, in Charles City County, Virginia, into a prominent and aristocratic family.
      His father, John Tyler Sr., was a wealthy planter, judge, and close associate of Thomas Jefferson, while his
      mother, Mary Marot Armistead Tyler, passed away when he was just seven years old. Growing up among Virginia’s
      elite, Tyler was exposed to politics and law from an early age. He attended the College of William & Mary at the
      remarkable age of twelve, where he studied law before being admitted to the bar. His early career was marked by
      his service in the Virginia House of Delegates, followed by his election to the U.S. House of Representatives and
      later as the Governor of Virginia. Influenced by Jeffersonian ideals, Tyler became a strong advocate for states'
      rights and limited federal power, opposing large federal infrastructure projects. These beliefs would shape his
      political career and define his leadership in the years to come.

        One of Tyler’s most significant achievements was the annexation of Texas, a controversial move that expanded U.S. territory but deepened the divide between pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions. He pushed for Texas' statehood despite opposition, laying the groundwork for the Mexican-American War. Additionally, his administration helped resolve a long-standing border dispute between Maine and Canada through the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, easing tensions with Britain. However, his presidency was largely marked by political isolation and resistance from Congress, making it difficult for him to enact broader policies. By the end of his term, Tyler’s lack of party support left him without a path to re-election, and he retired to Virginia, later aligning himself with the Confederacy during the Civil War.

      <div class="col-6 justify-content-center fs-2"> <h1 class="mx-5">John Tyler became the 10th president of the United States in 1841 after the unexpected death of William Henry Harrison, setting a crucial precedent for vice presidential succession. Despite being elected as Harrison’s running mate under the Whig Party, Tyler quickly clashed with his own party once in office. He vetoed a bill to re-establish the National Bank, a key Whig policy, which led to nearly all of his cabinet resigning and the Whigs formally expelling him from the party. Congress even attempted to impeach him—the first serious impeachment effort against a U.S. president. Despite these challenges, Tyler remained committed to his principles, advocating for limited federal power and states’ rights, which often put him at odds with both Congress and his former party.His presidency was marked by frequent use of the veto, earning him the nickname “His Accidency” from critics who saw him as an illegitimate leader.      </h1></div>
